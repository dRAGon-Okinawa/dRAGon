# dRAGon Development Mode
:::warning[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers]

In order to be as close as possible to the development environment, we **strongly** recommend using Visual Studio Code Dev Containers. You can find the configuration file in the `.devcontainer` folder.

If it's not possible please make sure you have the following tools installed with the **correct** versions:
* Java 17
* Gradle 8.7
* Node.js 20
* NPM 10
* "Unix like" System (Linux, MacOS)

However we do **NOT** accept any issues related to troubles encountered by **NOT** using the Dev Containers.
