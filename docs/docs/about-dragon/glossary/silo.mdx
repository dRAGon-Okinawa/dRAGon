# What's a Silo?
This entity is designed to store and retrieve chunks, the result of embeddings of documents. It is the basic building block of dRAGon.

A Silo is composed of three main components :
```mermaid

    subgraph silo1 [Silo]
    IngestorLoader
    EmbeddingModel
    VectorStore
    end
```

## How does it work?
The Ingestor Loader is responsible for loading the documents into the Silo : it can be done by reading files in a directory or by providing URLs. 
After the documents are loaded they are split into chunks (eg. paragraphs, sentences, etc.) by the Silo Splitter.
Each chunk is then transformed into a vector by the Embedding Model, which is then stored in the Vector Store for later retrieval.
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    IngestorLoader-- Load files over file system, URLs, ... -->DocumentSplitter
    DocumentSplitter-- Split documents into chunks -->EmbeddingModel
    EmbeddingModel-- Vectorize each chunk for retrieval similarity -->VectorStore
```
