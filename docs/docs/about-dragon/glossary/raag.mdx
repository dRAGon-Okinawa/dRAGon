# What's RaaG?
Ever wanted to have a chat with a LLM (Large Language Model) like GPT-4o, but with the ability to ask it questions about your data? RaaG is the answer to your needs!

RaaG is the acronyme for "RAG as a GPT"

## Why do we need RaaG?
You can already use LangChain or LlamaIndex to query your data, so why do you need RaaG?
