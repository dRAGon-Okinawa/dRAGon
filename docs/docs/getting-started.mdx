# Getting Started

Let's discover **dRAGon in less than 5 minutes**.

## dRAGon Startup Guide
:::danger
    dRAGon lacks of authentication and authorization mechanisms. It is not recommended to expose it to the internet or unsafe networks.
    These mechanisms will be implemented in a near future.
:::

:::warning
    dRAGon is still in active development stage and may contain bugs or incomplete features.
    No smooth upgrade path is guaranteed between versions.
    Can be broken at any time.
:::

### 1. Launch
:::note
    The best way to run dRAGon is to use Docker.
    If you want to run it without Docker, you can use Gradle and follow [dRAGon Development Mode](/docs/contributing/launch-dragon-dev).
:::

```shell
docker run --rm -p 1985:1985 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/documents:/documents --name dRAGon ghcr.io/dragon-okinawa/dragon:latest
```

:::info
    `/data` and `/documents` are optional volumes to mount. You can mount any directory you want!
    * `/data` is used to store the dRAGon databas and settings. If you want to keep your data between reboots, you should mount this volume.
    * `/documents` is used here to store the documents to be indexed inside the vector store (eg. by using FileSystem Ingestor).
